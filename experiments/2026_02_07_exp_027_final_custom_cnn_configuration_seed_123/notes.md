## Experiment: Seed 123

This experiment was conducted with same hyperparameters with a different seed to avoid lucky runs.

- training curve is stable, train accuracy approaching 99–100%
- validation curve has slight fluctuations, but converges nicely
- high accuracy, slightly higher than seed 42 run. Model is robust.
