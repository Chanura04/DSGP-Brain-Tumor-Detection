## Experiment: Seed 999

This experiment was conducted with same hyperparameters with a different seed to avoid lucky runs.

- training curve is stable, train accuracy approaching close to 100%
- validation curve has slight fluctuations, but converges nicely
- also robust, slightly different pattern than seed 123, but overall similar performance.
