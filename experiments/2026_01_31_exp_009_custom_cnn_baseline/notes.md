## Experiment: Learning Rate Ablation

All experiments use identical architecture, dataset, seed (42), and training
procedure. Only the learning rate was varied.

### lr = 0.0005 (baseline)
- Stable convergence
- Best validation loss at epoch 6
- Mild overfitting after epoch 6
- Best balance between convergence speed and generalization
