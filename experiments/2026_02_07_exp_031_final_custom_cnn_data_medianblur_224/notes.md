## Experiment: Data Ablation

All experiments use identical architecture, dataset, seed (42), and training
procedure.

# Data Preprocessing = Median Blur

- training curve is stable, train accuracy approaching close to 100%
- validation curve has slight fluctuations, but converges nicely and quickly
- Shows a little overfitting

Although the experiment 26 gave a stable model with high accuracy, model limitations were reached and other data preprocessing techniques were considered for the same model, to try and increase model accuracy and stability.
